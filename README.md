# CS4347 Singing Visualizer

Frontend for a school project to visualize singing voice using machine learning techniques.

Either record your voice or upload an audio file, and watch the melody and lyrics of the song be automatically transcribed.

## Development

Running for the first time

```bash
npm install
```

Starting local dev server on port 5000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Backend

The frontend relies on a backend to serve the machine learning models. Due to costs, it is unlikely the backend will remain up. Workarounds are TBD.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).
